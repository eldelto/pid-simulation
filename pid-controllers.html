        <p>
          A PID-controller is made up of three separate terms:
        </p>

        <ul class="org-ul">
          <li>P-term - Alters the controller output proportional to the error
            value. It creates a initial bump in the output value when the
            set-point changes is essential for the overall controller speed.</li>
          <li>I-term - Sums up the error value over time and changes the
            controller output according to that summed up value. It
            eliminates any remaining error that can not be corrected by
            other terms.</li>
          <li>D-term - Calculates the error change and tries to eliminate any
            change from the status quo therefore acting as a dampening factor</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="outline-container-org00b9793" class="outline-3">
        <h3 id="org00b9793"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> Self-Regulating Process</h3>
        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
          <p>
            A self-regulating process' output value stabilises after a
            step-change of the input value at a new value without additional
            controller input. This occurs when the process has some form of
            natural negative feedback loop. For example the water inside a
            water boiler can never get hotter than the heater coil and
            therefore stabilises at that temperature over time.
          </p>

          <p>
            This type of process can't be controlled by a pure P-controller
            as the proportional component of the output signal gets smaller
            in proportion to the current error and therefore the output finds
            its equilibrium somewhere below the set-point. To eliminate the
            error one can add an additional I-term to the controller that
            increases over time or instead control the 1. derivation of the
            output (e.g. temperature change instead of the absolute
            temperature).
          </p>

          <p>
            The amount of I-gain that can be applied depends on the time lag
            of the system where longer time lags increase the chance for
            oscillation.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="outline-container-org1ad7551" class="outline-3">
        <h3 id="org1ad7551"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> Integrating Process</h3>
        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
          <p>
            An integrating process is identified by its output value drifting
            away from the set-point after a step-change with a constant
            rate. A practical example is the orientation control of a
            quad-copter. If one increases the thrust of the motors on one
            side the drone will start rolling indefinitely until a correcting
            action is applied.
          </p>

          <p>
            Integrating processes can be controlled by pure P-controllers as
            the inherit integrating nature of the process eliminates the need
            for an additional integrating component within the controller.
          </p>

          <p>
            The amount of P-gain also depends on the time lag of the process
            as slower systems are more prone to oscillations.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="outline-container-orgd301d27" class="outline-3">
        <h3 id="orgd301d27"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> Runaway Process</h3>
        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
          <p>
            The output signal of a runaway process drifts away from the
            set-point with an increasing rate. The prime example is an
            inverted pendulum. Once the pendulum goes out of balance, gravity
            has even more leverage to tilt it downwards and so the error rate
            increases even more.
          </p>

          <p>
            Runaway processes are the hardest to control and sometimes only
            offer a limited error band in which they can be controlled
            successfully. Thinking about the inverted pendulum again, which
            is relatively easy to balance by hand if it is close to the
            set-point but gets increasingly difficult, if not impossible, the
            further it goes away.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because of this tendency to destabilise themselves a derivative
            controll component is necessary to hinder the system from
            drifting from the set-point on its own.

          <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-1">
            <p>
              In the example below our PID controller is in charge of the
              temperature change of the heating element within a water
              boiler. The setpoint is the desired water temperature.
            </p>

            <p>
              This system is in principle a self-regulating system if we would
              control the heating element's temperature in degrees
              directly. However tests showed that it is easier to control when
              we instead control the temperature change of the heating
              element, making it an integrating system.
            </p>

            <p>
              The main complications of this setup are the large time lag
              until the water heats up and the asymmetrical nature of the
              control process as the heating element can't get colder than the
              environment.
            </p>

          <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-2">
            <p>
              In this example the PID controller varies the RPM, and therefore
              the thrust, of the drone's motors to get it into a stable
              hover. The setpoint is the distance from the ground at which the
              drone should hover.
            </p>

            <p>
              This system is also an integrating system which gets most of its
              difficulty due to the large static error we have due to
              gravity. Therefore this control process needs the I-term of the
              controller to ramp up the motors to base level that counteracts
              gravity.
